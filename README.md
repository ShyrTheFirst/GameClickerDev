    Game created for the "Secret Santa Jam"


Introduction
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello!! A game about GameDev, fix bugs just by clicking!!!! (At least this game is easy to fix bugs).

This game is very simple, I didn't have much time to make it, but I hope someday I have the time to revisit and rework this. The idea is fun!
I hope you have some fun playing althought you can't save and things like that... Someday it'll!!

How-to-play
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need the following to execute the game:
python 3.0 or higher
libraries: pygame

Unfortanely I coudn't create a .exe file for this game yet :( .


This game is simple: just click in the bug in the middle of the screen until you kill it. 
Spend the money to improve damage and change your weapon!

You can choose one of the classes when you reach a certain level. (The classes will be better implemented too)

About the game
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
While I was thinking about programming to create my giftee a game (He is a programmer, so I wanted something related), I started thinking about the bugs.
It's the most time-consuming think in programming, afaik, so I decided to do something simple about it. You kill bugs to keep going... Just like in real life
but different.

There is nothing much to say about it. Just have fun and don't care much :)

Maybe my imagination... But it was better in my head than it's in this playable state. xD
